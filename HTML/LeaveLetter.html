    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request for Leave</p>
    <p>Dear Ashok Rajan,</p>
    <p>I am writing to formally request leave from work for 5 days, from January 10, 2025, to January 14, 2025. The reason for my leave is personal matters that require my immediate attention.</p>
    <p>I have ensured that all my current tasks and responsibilities are either completed or delegated to my colleague. I will also be available to assist remotely if any urgent matters arise during my absence.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your understanding and consideration. Please let me know if you require any further information.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Dhruv</p>
